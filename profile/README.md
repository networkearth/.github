## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Data, Knowledge, Answers:** Data powers models and analytics. Models and analytics build knowledge. Knowledge answers questions. The life of an answer rises this way and so the value of the models and the data follows in reverse. Questions drive what knowledge we seek, the knowledge we seek drives the data we collect. All three must coexist together. 

**A Pool of Expertise:** Answering questions is hard work that requires a great deal of expertise and a great deal of resources. So, to the extent that one can reuse these resouces and this expertise from one question to the next, the better. 

The dream of **Network Earth** is to pool together the techniques, resources, and expertise required to gather the data, build the knowledge, and thereby provide a consistent way to give the very best answers to at least some of the questions asked by ecological management. 

All things need a beginning and we start, by circumstance, in questions of time and space.
